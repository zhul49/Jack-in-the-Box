# Jack-in-the-Box Physics Simulation

This project is a physics-based simulation of a jack-in-the-box mechanism that models rigid-body motion, internal rotation, and collisions using first-principles dynamics.

The system consists of a rotating box and an internal cross-shaped “jack” with four tip masses. Motion is derived using Euler–Lagrange equations, and collisions between the jack tips and the box walls are handled using impulse-based impact modeling.
